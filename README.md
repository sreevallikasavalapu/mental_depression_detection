MENTAL DEPRESSION DETECTION USING EEG SIGNALS

Mental disorder incidence is increasing rapidly over the past 2 decades with global depression diagnosed patients reaching 322M as of 2015. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) has become a leading contributor to the global burden of diseases. 
However, it is diagnosed through a series of interviews carried out by Psychiatrists and Psychologists. The process is not only labor-consuming but also time-consuming.
Electroencephalography (EEG), as a non-invasive physiological data, provides a direct measure of postsynaptic potentials with millisecond temporal resolution. 
Since mental disorders, such as depression, are complex brain cognitive disfunction, EEG is naturally the common data that are favored by the researchers.
Our innovative solution integrates machine learning into the realm of Medical Diagnosis. 

Key components include:


1.Creating ECG (electrocardiogram) using EEG datasets which requires a package MNE(magnetoencephalography ) _python.

2.Setting montage(spatial arrangement) and co-ordinate information of EEG electrodes on the scalp.

3.Remove artifacts(movable elements) using Independent Component Analysis

4.To remove unwanted frequency components using different filtering operations

5.Using JSON for setting a backend visualisation interface for the plots

6.Displaying spatial distribution of EEG data at different time points
